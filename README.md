# HappinessIndicators

## What makes countries happy? 

Our research focuses on understanding what indicators influence a country’s happiness. We are looking to identify how changes in indicators from the Gallup World Poll are associated with happiness for countries and broader regions. Our analysis will discern which indicator(s) should be improved to boost happiness and well-being for the people of a certain area.
